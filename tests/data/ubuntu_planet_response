<p>Esta semana o trio maravilha dedicou a sua atenção a sugestões de leitura, técnica ou não, porque a vida não são só podcasts… As novidades no mundo SolusOS, a parceria da Canonical e da Samsung e o projecto Linux on Dex, sem esquecer a Festa do Software Livre da Moita 2018, que está já aí! Já sabes: Ouve, subscreve e partilha!</p>

	<title>Robert Ancell: Counting Code in GNOME Settings</title>

	<description><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I've been spending a bit of time recently working on <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center">GNOME Settings</a>. One part of this has been bringing some of the older panel code up to modern standards, one of which is making use of <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkBuilder.html">GtkBuilder templates</a>.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>I wondered if any of these changes would show in the stats, so I <a href="https://gist.github.com/robert-ancell/b84df04768c526471f5f7d88f2e32243">wrote a program</a> to analyse each branch in the git repository and break down the code between C and GtkBuilder. The results were graphed in Google Sheets:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-560aXn8MEyc/W-3RDctLj2I/AAAAAAAAVNw/5aSfLDUuSSkVA5qGymlKM9WTr_2fGN6NQCLcBGAs/s1600/GNOME%2BSettings%2BCode%2BBreakdown.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="651" data-original-width="1053" height="394" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-560aXn8MEyc/W-3RDctLj2I/AAAAAAAAVNw/5aSfLDUuSSkVA5qGymlKM9WTr_2fGN6NQCLcBGAs/s640/GNOME%2BSettings%2BCode%2BBreakdown.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This is just the user accounts panel, which shows some of the reduction in C code and increase in GtkBuilder data:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-596YwCpY654/W-3RP0RIcYI/AAAAAAAAVN0/xGV3dmQ8VAEhl9K7wCGLXbIS0cNUf0ODgCLcBGAs/s1600/User%2BAccounts%2BPanel%2BCode%2BBreakdown.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="656" data-original-width="1062" height="394" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-596YwCpY654/W-3RP0RIcYI/AAAAAAAAVN0/xGV3dmQ8VAEhl9K7wCGLXbIS0cNUf0ODgCLcBGAs/s640/User%2BAccounts%2BPanel%2BCode%2BBreakdown.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>Here's the breakdown of which panels make up the codebase:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OVD-5sLra7U/W-3RYOH3_BI/AAAAAAAAVN8/sSmyJ8ZC_S0Ve0vJ5-z49bys6zJLPNMhwCLcBGAs/s1600/GNOME%2BSettings%2BPanel%2BBreakdown.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="677" data-original-width="1095" height="394" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OVD-5sLra7U/W-3RYOH3_BI/AAAAAAAAVN8/sSmyJ8ZC_S0Ve0vJ5-z49bys6zJLPNMhwCLcBGAs/s640/GNOME%2BSettings%2BPanel%2BBreakdown.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />I don't think this draws any major conclusions, but is still interesting to see. Of note:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Some of the changes make in 3.28 did reduce the total amount of code! But it was quickly gobbled up by the new Thunderbolt panel. </li><li>Network and Printers are the dominant panels - look at all that code! </li><li>I ignored empty lines in the files in case differing coding styles would make some panels look bigger or smaller. It didn't seem to make a significant difference.</li><li>You can see a reduction in C code looking at individual panels that have been updated, but overall it gets lost in the total amount of code.</li></ul>I'll have another look in a few cycles when more changes have landed (I'm working on a <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/merge_requests/233">new sound panel</a> at the moment).</div></description>

	<title>Raphaël Hertzog: Freexian’s report about Debian Long Term Support, October 2018</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://raphaelhertzog.com/?p=3778</guid>
	<link>https://raphaelhertzog.com/2018/11/15/freexians-report-about-debian-long-term-support-october-2018/</link>
	<description><p><img alt="A Debian LTS logo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3226" height="128" src="https://raphaelhertzog.com/files/2015/03/Debian-LTS-2-small.png" width="128" />Like <a href="https://raphaelhertzog.com/tag/Freexian+LTS/">each month</a>, here comes a report about the work of <a href="http://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html">paid contributors</a> to <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">Debian LTS</a>.</p>
<h3>Individual reports</h3>
<p>In October, about 209 work hours have been dispatched among 13 paid contributors. Their reports are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2018/11/msg00023.html">Abhijith PA</a> did 1 hour (out of 10 hours allocated + 4 extra hours, thus keeping 13 extra hours for November).</li>
<li><a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2018-11-01-report/">Antoine Beaupré </a> did 24 hours (out of 24 hours allocated).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.decadent.org.uk/ben/blog/debian-lts-work-october-2018.html">Ben Hutchings</a> did 19 hours (out of 15 hours allocated + 4 extra hours).</li>
<li><a href="https://chris-lamb.co.uk/posts/free-software-activities-in-october-2018">Chris Lamb</a> did 18 hours (out of 18 hours allocated).</li>
<li><a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2018/11/msg00058.html">Emilio Pozuelo Monfort</a> did 12 hours (out of 30 hours allocated + 29.25 extra hours, thus keeping 47.25 extra hours for November).</li>
<li><a href="http://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20181110-lts-201810/">Holger Levsen</a> did 1 hour (out of 8 hours allocated + 19.5 extra hours, but he gave back the remaining hours due to his new role, see below).</li>
<li><a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2018/11/msg00040.html">Hugo Lefeuvre</a> did 10 hours (out of 10 hours allocated).</li>
<li><a href="https://gambaru.de/blog/2018/11/09/my-free-software-activities-in-october-2018/">Markus Koschany</a> did 30 hours (out of 30 hours allocated).</li>
<li><a href="https://sunweavers.net/blog/node/76">Mike Gabriel</a> did 4 hours (out of 8 hours allocated, thus keeping 4 extra hours for November).</li>
<li><a href="http://inguza.com/report/debian-long-term-support-work-2018-october">Ola Lundqvist </a> did 4 hours (out of 8 hours allocated + 8 extra hours, but gave back 4 hours, thus keeping 8 extra hours for November).</li>
<li><a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2018/11/msg00016.html">Roberto C. Sanchez</a> did 15.5 hours (out of 18 hours allocated, thus keeping 2.5 extra hours for November).</li>
<li><a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2018/11/msg00042.html">Santiago Ruano Rincón</a> did 10 hours (out of 28 extra hours, thus keeping 18 extra hours for November).</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.alteholz.eu/2018/11/my-debian-activities-in-october-2018/">Thorsten Alteholz</a> did 30 hours (out of 30 hours allocated).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Evolution of the situation</h3>
<p>In November we are welcoming Brian May and Lucas Kanashiro back as contributors after they took some break from this work.</p>
<p>Holger Levsen is stepping down as LTS contributor but is taking over the role of LTS coordinator that was solely under the responsibility of Raphaël Hertzog up to now. Raphaël continues to handle the administrative side, but Holger will coordinate the LTS contributors ensuring that the work is done and that it is well done.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html">number of sponsored hours</a> increased to 212 hours per month, we gained a new sponsor (that shall not be named since they don’t want to be publicly listed).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/status/release/oldstable">security tracker</a> currently lists 27 packages with a known CVE and the <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dla-needed.txt">dla-needed.txt file</a> has 27 packages needing an update.</p>

	<title>Stephen Kelly: Future Developments in clang-query</title>

	<description><h3>Getting started – clang-tidy AST Matchers</h3>
<p>Over the last few weeks I published some blogs on the Visual C++ blog about <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchers.html">Clang AST Matchers</a>. The series can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/10/19/exploring-clang-tooling-part-1-extending-clang-tidy">Extending clang-tidy</a>
</li><li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/10/23/exploring-clang-tooling-part-2-examining-the-clang-ast-with-clang-query">Examining the clang AST with clang-query</a>
</li><li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2018/11/06/exploring-clang-tooling-part-3-rewriting-code-with-clang-tidy">Rewriting code with clang-tidy</a>
</li></ul>
<p>I am not aware of any similar series existing which covers creation of <tt>clang-tidy</tt> checks, and use of <tt>clang-query</tt> to inspect the Clang AST and assist in the construction of AST Matcher expressions.  I hope the series is useful to anyone attempting to write <tt>clang-tidy</tt> checks.  Several people have reported to me that they have previously tried and failed to create <tt>clang-tidy</tt> extensions, due to various issues, including lack of information tying it all together.</p>
<p>Other issues with <tt>clang-tidy</tt> include the fact that it relies on the “mental model” a compiler has of C++ source code, which might differ from the “mental model” of regular C++ developers.  The compiler needs to have a very exact representation of the code, and needs to have a consistent design for the class hierarchy representing each standard-required feature.  This leads to many classes and class hierarchies, and a difficulty in discovering what is relevant to a particular problem to be solved.  </p>
<p>I noted several problems in those blog posts, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>clang-query</tt> does not show AST dumps and diagnostics at the same time&lt;
</li><li>Code completion does not work with <tt>clang-query</tt> on Windows
</li><li>AST Matchers which are appropriate to use in contexts are difficult to discover
</li><li>There is no tooling available to assist in discovery of source locations of AST nodes
</li></ul>
<p>Last week <a href="http://codedive.pl/index/speaker/name/stephen-kelly">at code::dive in Wroclaw</a>, I demonstrated tooling solutions to all of these problems. I look forward to video of that talk (and videos from the rest of the conference!) becoming available. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’ll publish some blog posts here showing the same new features in <tt>clang-query</tt> and <tt>clang-tidy</tt>.</p>
<h3><tt>clang-query</tt> in Compiler Explorer</h3>
<p>Recent work by the Compiler Explorer maintainers adds the possibility to use source code tooling with the website.  The compiler explorer contains new entries in a menu to enable a <tt>clang-tidy</tt> pane.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1598" style="width: 460px;"><img alt="clang-tidy in Compiler Explorer" class="size-full wp-image-1598" data-attachment-id="1598" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;clang-tidy in Compiler Explorer&lt;/p&gt; " data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="clang-tidy in Compiler Explorer" data-large-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/compiler-explorer-new-tool.gif?w=450&amp;h=258?w=450" data-medium-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/compiler-explorer-new-tool.gif?w=450&amp;h=258?w=300" data-orig-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/compiler-explorer-new-tool.gif?w=450&amp;h=258" data-orig-size="1601,919" data-permalink="https://steveire.wordpress.com/2018/11/11/future-developments-in-clang-query/compiler-explorer-new-tool/" height="258" src="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/compiler-explorer-new-tool.gif?w=450&amp;h=258" width="450" /><p class="wp-caption-text">clang-tidy in Compiler Explorer</p></div>
<p>I demonstrated use of compiler explorer to use the <tt>clang-query</tt> tool at the code::dive conference, building upon the recent work by the compiler explorer developers.  This feature will get upstream in time, but can be used with <a href="http://ec2-52-14-16-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:10240/z/HHJGIi">my own AWS instance for now</a>.  This is suitable for exploration of the effect that changing source code has on match results, and orthogonally, the effect that changing the AST Matcher has on the match results.  It is also accessible via <a href="http://cqe.steveire.com">cqe.steveire.com</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that Compiler Explorer is running <tt>clang-query</tt> in script mode, so it can process multiple <tt>let</tt> and <tt>match</tt> calls for example.  The new command <tt>set print-matcher true</tt> helps distinguish the output from the matcher which causes the output.  The <tt>help</tt> command is <a href="http://ec2-52-14-16-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:10240/z/Z-O3tm">also available</a> with listing of the new features.</p>
<p>The issue of <tt>clang-query</tt> not printing both diagnostic information and AST information at the same time means that users of the tool need to alternate between writing</p>
<pre>set output diag
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>set output dump
</pre>
<p>to access the different content.  Recently, I committed a change to make it possible to enable both output and diag output from <tt>clang-query</tt> at the same time.  New commands follow the same structure as the <tt>set output</tt> command:</p>
<pre>enable output dump
disable output dump
</pre>
<p>The <tt>set output &lt;feature&gt;</tt> command remains as an “exclusive” setting to enable only one output feature and disable all others.</p>
<h3>Dumping possible AST Matchers</h3>
<p>This command design also enables the possibility of extending the features which <tt>clang-query</tt> can output.  Up to now, developers of <tt>clang-tidy</tt> extensions had to inspect the AST corresponding to their source code using <tt>clang-query</tt> and then use that understanding of the AST to create an AST Matcher expression.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1599" data-attachment-id="1599" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="allenabled" data-large-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/allenabled.png?w=450&amp;h=295?w=450" data-medium-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/allenabled.png?w=450&amp;h=295?w=300" data-orig-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/allenabled.png?w=450&amp;h=295" data-orig-size="1635,1072" data-permalink="https://steveire.wordpress.com/2018/11/11/future-developments-in-clang-query/allenabled/" height="295" src="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/allenabled.png?w=450&amp;h=295" width="450" /></p>
<p>That mapping to and from the AST “mental model” is not necessary.  New features I am in the process of upstreaming to <tt>clang-query</tt> enable the output of AST Matchers which may be used with existing bound AST nodes. The command</p>
<pre>enable output matcher
</pre>
<p>causes <tt>clang-query</tt> to <a href="http://ec2-52-14-16-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:10240/z/Y66i1P">print out all matcher expressions</a> which can be combined with the bound node.  This cuts out the requirement to dump the AST in such cases.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1600" data-attachment-id="1600" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="all-no-ast" data-large-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/all-no-ast.png?w=450&amp;h=295?w=450" data-medium-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/all-no-ast.png?w=450&amp;h=295?w=300" data-orig-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/all-no-ast.png?w=450&amp;h=295" data-orig-size="1744,1143" data-permalink="https://steveire.wordpress.com/2018/11/11/future-developments-in-clang-query/all-no-ast/" height="295" src="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/all-no-ast.png?w=450&amp;h=295" width="450" /></p>
<p>Inspecting the AST is still useful as a technique to discover possible AST Matchers and how they correspond to source code.  For example if the <tt>functionDecl()</tt> matcher is already known and understood, it can be dumped to see that function calls are represented by the <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1CallExpr.html">CallExpr</a> in the Clang AST.  Using the <tt>callExpr()</tt> AST Matcher and dumping possible matchers to use with it leads to the discovery that <tt>callee(functionDecl())</tt> can be used to determine particulars of the function being called. Such discoveries are not possible by only reading AST output of <tt>clang-query</tt>.</p>
<h3>Dumping possible Source Locations</h3>
<p>The other important discovery space in creation of <tt>clang-tidy</tt> extensions is that of Source Locations and Source Ranges.  Developers creating extensions must currently rely on the documentation of the Clang AST to discover available source locations which might be relevant. Usually though, developers have the opposite problem.  They have source code, and they want to know how to access a source location from the AST node which corresponds semantically to that line and column in the source.</p>
<p>It is important to make use a semantically relevant source location in order to make reliable tools which refactor at scale and without human intervention. For example, a cursory inspection of the locations available from a <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1FunctionDecl.html">FunctionDecl</a> AST node might lead to the belief that the return type is available at the <tt>getBeginLoc()</tt> of the node.</p>
<p>However, this is immediately challenged by the C++11 trailing return type feature, where the actual return type is located at the end.  For a semanticallly correct location, you must currently use </p>
<pre>getTypeSourceInfo()-&gt;getTypeLoc().getAs().getReturnLoc().getBeginLoc()
</pre>
<p>It should be possible to use <tt>getReturnTypeSourceRange()</tt>, but <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39567">a bug in clang</a> prevents that as it does not appreciate the trailing return types feature.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1601" data-attachment-id="1601" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="functionDecl_loc" data-large-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/functiondecl_loc.png?w=450&amp;h=270?w=450" data-medium-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/functiondecl_loc.png?w=450&amp;h=270?w=300" data-orig-file="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/functiondecl_loc.png?w=450&amp;h=270" data-orig-size="828,497" data-permalink="https://steveire.wordpress.com/2018/11/11/future-developments-in-clang-query/functiondecl_loc/" height="270" src="https://steveire.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/functiondecl_loc.png?w=450&amp;h=270" width="450" /></p>
<p>Once again, my new output feature of <tt>clang-query</tt> presents a solution to this discovery problem.  The command </p>
<pre>enable output srcloc
</pre>
<p>causes <tt>clang-query</tt> to <a href="http://ec2-52-14-16-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:10240/z/2DN-mh">output the source locations by accessor and caret</a> corresponding to the source code for each of the bound nodes.  By inspecting that output, developers of <tt>clang-tidy</tt> extensions can discover the correct expression (usually via the clang::TypeLoc heirarchy) corresponding to the source code location they are interested in refactoring.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>I have made many more modifications to <tt>clang-query</tt> which I am in the process of upstreaming.  My Compiler explorer instance is listed as the ‘clang-query-future’ tool, while the clang-query-trunk tool runs the current trunk version of clang-query.  Both can be enabled for <a href="http://ec2-52-14-16-249.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:10240/z/SiyGHJ">side-by-side comparison</a> of the future <tt>clang-query</tt> with the exising one. </p></description>

	<title>Diego Turcios: Access to AWS Postgres instance in private subnet</title>

	<description>I have been working with AWS in the last days and encounter some issues when using RDS.  Generally when you're working in development environment you have setup your database as Publicly accessible and this isn't an issue. But when you're working in Production. So we place the Amazon RDS database into a private subnet. What we need to do for connecting to the database using PgAdmin or other tool?<br /><br />We're going to use one of the most common methods for doing this. You will need to launch an Amazon EC2 instance in the public subnet and then use it as jumping box.<br /><br />So after you have your EC2, you will need to run the following command.<br />See explantion below  <br /><br />After this, you will need to configure your PgAdmin.<br />The host name will be your localhost, the port is the same you define in the above command.<br />Maintenance database will be your DB name and the username you have for connecting.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zeT1i9uVHjw/W-JRNekhscI/AAAAAAAARDU/43B_8EIlyi4-0Zqdgp0aeP63zFRKYWRcgCEwYBhgL/s1600/Connect-Prod.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="593" data-original-width="552" height="400" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zeT1i9uVHjw/W-JRNekhscI/AAAAAAAARDU/43B_8EIlyi4-0Zqdgp0aeP63zFRKYWRcgCEwYBhgL/s400/Connect-Prod.png" width="371" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Hope this helps you connect to your databases.</div><br /></description>

	<title>Jono Bacon: My Clients Are Hiring Community Roles: Corelight, Scality, and Solace</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.jonobacon.com/?p=10037</guid>
	<link>https://www.jonobacon.com/2018/11/04/my-clients-are-hiring-community-roles-corelight-scality-and-solace/</link>
	<description><p>One of the things I love about working with such a <a href="https://www.jonobacon.com/consulting/clients/">diverse range of clients</a> is helping them to shape, source, and mentor high-quality staff to build and grow their communities.</p>

<p>Well, three of clients <a href="https://www.corelight.com/">Corelight</a>, <a href="https://www.scality.com/">Scality</a>, and <a href="https://solace.com/">Solace</a> are all hiring community staff for their teams. I know many of you work in community management, so I always want to share new positions here in case you want to apply. If these look interesting, you should <strong>apply via the role description</strong> – don’t send me your resume. <strong>If we know each other</strong> (as in, we are friends/associates), feel free to reach out to me if you have questions.</p>

<p>(These are listed alphabetically based on the company name)</p>

<h1>Corelight Director of Community</h1>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.corelight.com/company/careers/1425439">See the role here</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.corelight.com/">Corelight</a> are doing some really interesting work. They provide security solutions based around the <a href="https://www.bro.org/">Bro</a> security monitor, and they invest heavily in that community (hiring staff, sponsoring events, producing code and more). Corelight are very focused on open source and being good participants in the Bro community. This role will not just serve Corelight but also support and grow the Bro community.</p>

<h1>Scality Technical Community Manager</h1>

<p><strong><a href="https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/scalitycom/view/P_AAAAAADAAADAZuCTzREVXs">See the role here</a></strong></p>

<p>I started working with <a href="https://www.scality.com/">Scality</a> a while back with the focus of growing their open source <a href="https://www.zenko.io/">Zenko</a> community. As I started shaping the community strategy with them, we hired for the <em>Director Of Community</em> role there, and my friend Stefano Maffulli got it, who had done great work at Dreamhost and OpenStack.</p>

<p>Well, Stef needs to hire someone for his team, and this is a role with a huge amount of potential. It will be focused on building, fostering, and growing the Zenko community, producing technical materials, working with developers, speaking, and more. Stef is a great guy and will be a great manager to work for.</p>

<h1>Solace Director Of Community and Developer Community Evangelist</h1>

<p><a href="https://solace.com/">Solace</a> have built a lightning-fast infrastructure messaging platform and they are building a community focused on supporting developers who use their platform. They are a great team, and are really passionate about not just building a community, but doing it the right way.</p>

<p>They are hiring for two roles. One will be leading the overall community strategy and delivery and the other will be an evangelist role focused on building awareness and developer engagement.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://solace.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=92">See the Director Of Community role here</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://solace.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=49">See the Developer Community Evangelist role here</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All three of these companies are doing great work, and really focused on building community the right way. Check out the roles and best of luck!</p>

	<title>Stephen Michael Kellat: Writing Up Plan B</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:skellat.freeshell.org,2018-11-04:/blog/writing-up-plan-b.html</guid>
	<link>http://skellat.freeshell.org/blog/writing-up-plan-b.html</link>
	<description><img src="http://img.shields.io/liberapay/receives/smkellat.svg?logo=liberapay" />
<img src="http://img.shields.io/liberapay/patrons/smkellat.svg?logo=liberapay" />
<img src="http://img.shields.io/liberapay/goal/smkellat.svg?logo=liberapay" />
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;">With the prominence of things like Liberapay and Patreon as well as Snowdrift.coop, I have had to look at the tax implications of them all.  There is no single tax regime on this planet.  Developers and other freelancers who might make use of one of these services within the F/LOSS frame of reference are frequently <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">not</span><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> within the USA frame of reference.  That makes a difference.</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">I also have to state at the outset that this does not constitute legal advice.  I am not a lawyer.  I am most certainly not your lawyer.  If anything these recitals are my setting out my review of all this as being “Plan B” due to continuing high tensions surrounding being a federal civil servant in the United States.  With an election coming up Tuesday where one side treats it as a normal routine event while the other is regarding it as Ragnarok and is acting like humanity is about to face an imminent extinction event, changing things up in life may be worthwhile.</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">An instructive item to consider is Internal Revenue Service Publication 334 </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">Tax Guide for Small Business (For Individuals Who Use Schedule C or C-EZ)</span><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">.  The current version can be found online at </span><a class="Internet20link" href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-334"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-334</span></a><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">.  Just because you receive money from people over the Internet does not necessarily mean it is free from taxation.  Generally the income a developer, freelance documentation writer, or a freelancer in general might receive from a Liberapay or Snowdrift.coop appears to fall under “gross receipts”.  </span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">A recent opinion of the United States Tax Court (</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">Felton v. Commissioner</span><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">, T.C. Memo 2018-168) discusses the issue of “gift” for tax purposes rather nicely in comparison to what Liberapay mentions in its FAQ.  You can find the FAQ at </span><a class="Internet20link" href="https://liberapay.com/about/faq"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">https://liberapay.com/about/faq</span></a><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">.  The opinion can be found at </span><a class="Internet20link" href="https://www.ustaxcourt.gov/ustcinop/OpinionViewer.aspx?ID=11789"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">https://www.ustaxcourt.gov/ustcinop/OpinionViewer.aspx?ID=11789</span></a><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">.  After reading the discussion in </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">Felton</span><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 16.0px;">, I remain assured that in the United States context anything received via Liberapay would have to be treated as gross receipts in the United States.  The rules are different in the European Union where Liberapay is based and that’s perfectly fine.  In the end I have to answer to the tax authorities in the United States.</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">The good part about reporting matters on Schedule C is that it preserves participation in Social Security and allows a variety of business expenses and deductions to be taken.  Regular wage-based employees pay into Social Security via the FICA tax.  Self-employed persons pay into Social Security via SECA tax.</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Now, there are various works I would definitely ask for support if I left government.  Such includes:</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; clear: left;">
      <li>
        <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Freelance documentation writing</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Emergency Management/Homeland Security work under the aegis of my church</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Podcast production</span></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Printing &amp; Publishing</span></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">For podcast production, general news reviews would be possible.  Going into actual entertainment programming would be nice.  There are ideas I’m still working out.</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Printing &amp; Publishing would involve getting small works into print on a more rapid cycle in light of an increasingly censored Internet.  As the case of Gab.ai shows, you can have one of your users do something horrible but not actually do anything as a site but still have all your hosting partners withdraw service so as to knock you offline.  Outside the context of the USA, total shutdowns of access to the Internet still occur from time to time in other countries.</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Emergency Management comes under the helping works of the church.</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">As to documentation writing, I used to write documentation for Xubuntu.  I want to do that again.</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">As to the proliferation of codes of conduct that are appearing everywhere, I can only offer the following statement:</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">“I am generally required to obey the United States Constitution and laws of the United States of America, the Constitution of the State of Ohio and Ohio’s laws, and the orders of any commanding officers appointed to me as a member of the unorganized militia (Ohio Revised Code 5923.01(D), Title 10 United States Code Section 246(b)(2)).  Codes of Conduct adopted by projects and organizations that conflict with those legal responsibilities must either be disregarded or accommodations must otherwise be sought.”</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"><span style="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">So, that’s “Plan B”.  The dollar amounts remain flexible at the moment as I’m still waiting for matters to pan out at work.  If things turn sour at my job, I at least have plans to hit the ground running seeking contracts and otherwise staying afloat.</span></p>
    <p class="Standard" style="font-size: 16.0px;"> </p>

<p>If you are having the following error on your Gentoo system:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> Can't open the database file '/var/cache/eix/portage.eix' for writing (mode = 'wb') 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Don’t waste your time, simply the /var/cache/eix directory is not present and/or writeable by the eix/portage use</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mkdir -p /var/cache/eix
chmod +w /var/cache/eix*

<p>Basic story is that eix will drop privileges to portage user when ran as root.</p></description>

	<title>Jonathan Riddell: Red Hat and KDE</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://jriddell.org/?p=885</guid>
	<link>https://jriddell.org/2018/11/02/red-hat-and-kde/</link>
	<description><p>By a strange coincidence the news broke this morning that RHEL is deprecating KDE. The real surprise here is that RHEL supported KDE all.  Back in the 90s they were entirely against KDE and put lots of effort into our friendly rivals Gnome.  It made some sense since at the time Qt was under a not-quite-free licence and there’s no reason why a company would want to support another company’s lock in as well as shipping incompatible licences.  By the time Qt become fully free they were firmly behind Gnome.  Meanwhile Rex and a team of hard working volunteers packaged it anyway and gained many users.  When Red Hat was turned into the all open Fedora and the closed RHEL, Fedora was able to embrace KDE as it should but at some point the Fedora Next initiative again put KDE software in second place. Meanwhile RHEL did use Plasma 4 and hired a number of developers to help us in our time of need which was fabulous but all except one have left some time ago and nobody expected it to continue for long.</p>
<p>So the deprecation is not really new or news and being picked up by the news is poor timing for Red Hat, it’s unclear if they want some distraction from the IBM news or just The Register playing around.  The community has always been much better at supporting out software for their users, maybe now the community run EPEL archive can include modern Plasma 5 instead of being stuck on the much poorer previous release.</p>
<p>Plasma 5 is now lightweight and feature full.  We get new users and people rediscovering us every day who report it as the most usable and pleasant way to run their day.  From my recent trip in Barcelona I can see how a range of different users from university to schools to government consider Plasma 5 the best way to support a large user base.  We now ship on high end devices such as the KDE Slimbook down to the low spec value device of Pinebook.  Our software leads the field in many areas such as video editor Kdenlive, or painting app Krita or educational suite GCompris.  Our range of projects is wider than ever before with textbook project WikiToLearn allowing new ways to learn and we ship our own software through KDE Windows, Flatpak builds and KDE neon with Debs, Snaps and Docker images.</p>
<p>It is a pity that RHEL users won’t be there to enjoy it by default. But, then again, they never really were. KDE is collaborative, open, privacy aware and with a vast scope of interesting projects after 22 years we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible and fun.</p>

	<title>Diego Turcios: Getting Docker Syntax In Gedit</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2727276651897032784.post-5537018131686901767</guid>
	<link>http://blog.diegoturcios.com/2018/11/getting-docker-syntax-in-gedit.html</link>
	<description>I have been working with docker in the last days, and encounter the syntax issue with gedit. Just pure plain text. So make a small search and found an easy way for fixing this. I found Jasper J.F. van den Bosch <a href="https://github.com/ilogue" target="_blank">repository</a> in GitHub and found the solution for this simple problem.<br />We need to download the docker.lang file, available here: <a href="https://github.com/ilogue/docker.lang/blob/master/docker.lang">https://github.com/ilogue/docker.lang/blob/master/docker.lang</a><br /><br />After that, you go to the folder you save the file and do the following command.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>sudo mv docker.lang /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/ </b></blockquote>If this doesn't work you can try the following:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>sudo mv docker.lang  ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/</b></blockquote>And that's all!<br /><br />Screenshot of gedit with no docker lang<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9ZAAM14Ofd8/W9x4c5FOJBI/AAAAAAAARCg/DZyRbdgCTX86qATTnUE_fsLhTxudMREPACLcBGAs/s1600/noSyntax-Docker.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="640" data-original-width="1270" height="161" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9ZAAM14Ofd8/W9x4c5FOJBI/AAAAAAAARCg/DZyRbdgCTX86qATTnUE_fsLhTxudMREPACLcBGAs/s320/noSyntax-Docker.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Screenshot of gedit with docker lang</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HvKGXR9GuSo/W9x4c6q1qbI/AAAAAAAARCc/94i0T_p8SS4sUrDTRVvTD5ksVuSTRhtBACEwYBhgL/s1600/WithDocker.png" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="661" data-original-width="1188" height="178" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HvKGXR9GuSo/W9x4c6q1qbI/AAAAAAAARCc/94i0T_p8SS4sUrDTRVvTD5ksVuSTRhtBACEwYBhgL/s320/WithDocker.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /></description>

<h4>4.14 Roadmap Updates</h4>
<p>The Xfce development team has worked on tidying up the <a href="https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/4.14/roadmap">Xfce 4.14 roadmap</a> over the last few days. Statuses have been updated, pending work has been moved to the top of each section, and completion percents have been adjusted to better reflect each project’s progress. With these updates, we can now see that…</p>
<p><em><strong>Xfce 4.14 is now approximately 83% complete.</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course, we need all the help we can get to get this milestone out the door. Check out the <a href="https://xfce.org/getinvolved">Xfce Contribute</a> page to find out how you can help.</p>
<h3>What’s Next?</h3>
<p>With the 18.10 release now behind us, and the 19.04 cycle starting today, it’s time to get back to work! No release goals have been determined yet, so stay tuned to the <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/xubuntu-devel">Xubuntu Development mailing list</a> for updates about Xubuntu 19.04 “<a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/10/ubuntu-19-04-name-revealed">Disco Dingo</a>” development.</p></description>

	<title>David Tomaschik: Understanding Shellcode: The Reverse Shell</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://systemoverlord.com/2018/10/30/understanding-shellcode-the-reverse-shell</guid>

	<description><p>A recent conversation with a coworker inspired me to start putting
together a series of blog posts to examine what it is that shellcode does.  In
the first installment, I’ll dissect the basic reverse shell.</p>

<p>First, a couple of reminders: shellcode is the machine code that is injected
into the flow of a program as the result of an exploit.  It generally must be
position independent as you can’t usually control where it will be loaded in
memory.  A reverse shell initiates a TCP connection from the compromised host
back to a host under the control of the attacker.  It then launches a shell with
which the attacker can interact.</p>



<h2 id="reverse-shell-in-c">Reverse Shell in C</h2>

<p>Let’s examine a basic reverse shell in C.  Error handling is elided, both for
the space in this post, and because most shellcode is not going to have error
handling.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-shell-steps">Reverse Shell Steps</h2>

<p>As can be seen, there are approximately 6 steps in setting up a reverse shell.
Once they are understood, this can be converted to proper shellcode.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First we need to allocate a socket structure in the kernel with a call to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">socket</code>.  This is a wrapper for a system call (since it has effects in
kernel space).  On x86, this wraps a system call called
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketcall.2.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">socketcall</code></a>, which
is a single entry point for dispatching all socket-related system calls.  On
x86-64, the different socket system calls are actually distinct system calls,
so this will call the <code class="highlighter-rouge">socket</code> system call.  It needs to know the address
family (<code class="highlighter-rouge">AF_INET</code> for IPv4) and the socket type (<code class="highlighter-rouge">SOCK_STREAM</code> for TCP, it
would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">SOCK_DGRAM</code> for UDP).  This returns an integer that is a file
descriptor for the socket.</li>
  <li>Next, we need to setup a <code class="highlighter-rouge">struct sockaddr_in</code>, which includes the family
(<code class="highlighter-rouge">AF_INET</code> again), and the port number in network byte order (big-endian).</li>
  <li>We also need to put the IP address into the structure.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">inet_pton</code> can parse
a string form into the struct.  In a <code class="highlighter-rouge">struct sockaddr_in</code>, this is a 4 byte
value, again in network byte order.</li>
  <li>We now have the full structure setup, so we can initiate a connection to the
remote host using the already-created socket.  This is done with a call to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">connect</code>.  Like <code class="highlighter-rouge">socket</code>, this is a wrapper for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">socketcall</code> system
call on x86, and for a <code class="highlighter-rouge">connect</code> system call on x86-64.</li>
  <li>We want the shell to use our socket when it is handling standard input/output
(<code class="highlighter-rouge">stdio</code>) functions.  To do this, we duplicate the file descriptor from the
socket to each of <code class="highlighter-rouge">STDIN</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">STDOUT</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">STDERR</code>.  Like so many, <code class="highlighter-rouge">dup2()</code> is a
thin wrapper around a system call.</li>
  <li>Finally, we setup the arguments for our shell, and launch it with <code class="highlighter-rouge">execve</code>,
yet another system call.  This one will replace the current binary image with
the targeted binary (<code class="highlighter-rouge">/bin/sh</code>) and then execute it from the entry point.  It
will execute with its standard input, output, and error connected to the
network socket.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-not-shellcode-in-c">Why not shellcode in C?</h2>

<p>So, if we have a working function, why can’t we just use that as shellcode?
Well, even if we compile position independent code (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-pie -fPIE</code> in gcc), this
code will still have many library calls in it.  In a normal program, this is no
problem, as it will be linked with the C library and run fine.  However, this
relies on the loader doing the right thing, including the placement of the <a href="https://systemoverlord.com/2017/03/19/got-and-plt-for-pwning.html">PLT
and GOT</a>.  When we inject shellcode, we
only inject the machine code, and don’t include any data areas necessary for the
location of the GOT.</p>

<p>What about statically linking the C library to avoid all these problems?  While
that has the potential to work, any constants (like the strings for the IP
address and the shell path) will be located in a different section of the
binary, and so the code will be unable to reference those.  (Unless we inject
that section as well and fixup the relative addresses, but in that case, the
complexity of our loader approaches the complexity of our entire shellcode.)</p>

<h2 id="reverse-shell-in-x86">Reverse Shell in x86</h2>

<p>My shellcode below will be written with the intent of being as clear as possible
as a learning instrument.  Consequently, it is neither the shortest possible
shellcode, nor is it free of “bad characters” (null bytes, newlines, etc.).  It
is also written as NASM assembly.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The structural simularities between either assembly implementation and the
C source code should be fairly evident.  When I write shellcode, I usually write
out the list of steps involved, then write a version in C, and finally translate
to the assembly for the shellcode.  I’m a bit of a control freak, so whenever I
need custom shellcode, I got straight to the assembly.</p>

<p>Let <a href="https://twitter.com/matir">me know</a> if there’s a particular shellcode
payload you’re interested in me covering or if you have feedback on the style or
usefulness of these posts.</p></description>

	<title>Santiago Zarate: Setting up postfix, dovecot and sieve</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://foursixnine.io/blog/2018/10/26/postfix-dovecot-sieve</guid>
	<link>https://foursixnine.io/blog/2018/10/26/postfix-dovecot-sieve.html</link>
	<description><h1 id="the-horror">The horror</h1>
<p>While trying to set up my mail system, I ran into multiple tutorials to figure
out what was the best way to avoid multiple error messages, mainly because you,
like me (you silly human!), simply copy and pasted random stuff from stack 
overflow, and tutorials in howtoforge and places like that…</p>

<h2 id="the-mistakes">The mistakes</h2>
<p>You tried something like this</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>spamassassin unix - n n - - pipe flags=DROhu user=vmail argv=/usr/bin/spamc -e /usr/lib/dovecot/deliver -f ${sender} -d ${user}@${nexthop} 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mailbox_transport = lmtp:unix:private/lmtp
virtual_transport = lmtp:unix:private/lmtp
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-pain">The pain</h2>
<p>so you ended up with something that looks similar to this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Oct 24 01:13:24 nergal postfix/pipe[10207]: fatal: get_service_attr: unknown username: vmail
Oct 24 01:13:25 nergal postfix/master[10104]: warning: process /usr/lib/postfix/bin//pipe pid 10207 exit status 1
Oct 24 01:13:25 nergal postfix/qmgr[10106]: warning: private/spamassassin socket: malformed response
Oct 24 01:13:25 nergal postfix/master[10104]: warning: /usr/lib/postfix/bin//pipe: bad command startup -- throttling
Oct 24 01:13:25 nergal postfix/qmgr[10106]: warning: transport spamassassin failure -- see a previous warning/fatal/panic logfile record for the problem description
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="resignation">Resignation</h2>

<p>So what worked for me was to leave the service in the master.cf as I had it working…</p>

<p>and simply add to master.cf</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>spamassassin unix - n   n - - pipe flags=R     user=app argv=/usr/bin/spamc -e /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -f ${sender} ${recipient}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and in the main.cf</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mailbox_command = /usr/lib/dovecot/deliver
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="the-light">The light</h2>

<p>Sieve filtering started to work after these changes :)</p>

	<title>Serge Hallyn: Outdoors laptop (part 2)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://s3hh.wordpress.com/?p=621</guid>
	<link>https://s3hh.wordpress.com/2018/10/25/outdoors-laptop-part-2/</link>
	<description><p>Some time ago <a href="https://s3hh.wordpress.com/2017/04/15/outdoors-laptop/">I posted</a> about wanting an outdoor laptop. The first option I listed was a panasonic toughbook. Recently (a year and a half later) I finally ordered one. I ordered from bobjohnson.com, because the people there are a class act who’ve been calmly answering my questions for a long time.</p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<p>* It has a transflective display. This means that it is emissive, but also uses reflected sunlight to boost brightness, up to 6000 nits. In comparison, my previous thinkpad was 350 nit (unusable sometimes even in shade), and my macbook was 500nit. With this laptop, I can leave the display on 25% brightness and move from a dark basement to hurt-my-skin bright sunlight.</p>
<p>* It’s ‘fully rugged’, so using it in rain or dust storms should not be an issue. (I lost 4G ram in my thinkpad to dust).</p>
<p>* It has a shoulder strap ($20 extra) screwed on solidly.</p>
<p>* It has a touchscreen with stylus. (To use this under ubuntu 18.04 I had to install xserver-xorg-input-evdev and remove xserver-xorg-input-libinput. Note just installing evdev was not enough) I may look like a dweeb, but I prefer this to smudging my screen.</p>
<p>The laptop I got is a CF-19 MK6. This is several years old and refurbished. The reason I went with this instead of a new toughbook (besides price) is because, as far as I can tell, only the CF-19 MK5 through MK8 have the transflective display. The replacement for the CF-19 (the CF-20) may have a better screen (i’ve not seen it), but it is not transflective and comes in at “only” 1000nit. Same with the slightly larger nonconvertable laptops.</p>
<p>Mind you, there is (I trust) a reason these screens did not take off – the colors are kind of washed out, and it’s low resolution. But for reading kernel code by the pool without draining the battery in 1 hr, the only thing I can imagine being better is an eink screen.</p>
<p>The CF-19 is compact: it’s a 10″ (convertible) netbook. This keyboard is more cramped than on my old s100 netbook. I do actually kind of like the keys – they have a good travel depth and a nice click. But it’s weird going back to a full-size keyboard.</p>
<p>The first time I measured the battery life, it shut down when battery listed 36% remaining, after a mere got 3 hours. Panasonic had advertised 10 hours for this laptop. 3 was unacceptable, and I was about ready to send it back. But, reading the powertop output, I noticed that the sound card was listed as taking tons of battery power. So for my next run I did a powertop –auto-tune, and got over 4 hours battery life. Then I noticed bluetooth radio doing the same, so I did rmmod btusb. These are now all done on startup by systemd. The battery still stops at 35%, which takes getting used to, but it’s acceptable.</p>
<p>4.5 hours is still limiting, so I picked up a second battery and an external charger. I can charge one battery while using the other, or take both batteries along for a longer trip.</p>
<p>In summary – i may have found my outdoors laptop. I’d still prefer it be thinner, with a slightly larger and mechanical keyboard, and have 12 hour battery life, delivered on a unicorn…</p>
<p>(Here is an attempt to show the screen in very bright sunlight. It’s hard to get a good photo, since the camera wants to play its own games) :</p></description>

	<title>Julian Andres Klode: Migrated website from ikiwiki to Hugo</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.jak-linux.org/2018/10/25/migrated-website-from-ikiwiki-to-hugo/</guid>
	<link>https://blog.jak-linux.org/2018/10/25/migrated-website-from-ikiwiki-to-hugo/</link>
	<description><p>So, I’ve been using ikiwiki for my website since 2011. At the time, I was hosting
the website on a tiny hosting package included in a DSL contract - nothing dynamic
possible, so a static site generator seemed like a good idea.
ikiwiki was a good social fit at the time, as it was packaged in Debian and developed
by a Debian Developer.</p>

<p>Today, I finished converting it to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>I did not really have a huge problem with ikiwiki, but I recently converted my blog
from wordpress to hugo and it seemed to make sense to have one technology for both,
especially since I don’t update the website very often and forget ikiwiki’s special
things.</p>

<p>One thing that was somewhat annoying is that I built a custom ikiwiki plugin for the
menu in my template, so I had to clone it’s repository into <code>~/.ikiwiki</code> every time,
rather than having a self-contained website. Well, it was a submodule of my dotfiles
repo.</p>

<p>Another thing was that ikiwiki had a lot of git integration, and when you build your
site it tries to push things to git repositories and all sorts of weird stuff – Hugo
just does one thing: It builds your page.</p>

<p>One thing that Hugo does a lot better than ikiwiki is the built-in server which allows
you to run `hugo server´ and get a local http URL you can open in the browser with
live-reload as you save files. Super convenient to check changes (and of course, for
writing this blog post)!</p>

<p>Also, in general, Hugo feels a lot more <em>modern</em>. ikiwiki is from 2006, Hugo is from
2013. Especially recent Hugo versions added quite a few features for asset management.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fingerprinting of assets like css (inserting hash into filename) - ikiwiki just contains
its style in <code>style.css</code> (and your templates in other statically named files), so if you
switch theming details, you could break things because the CSS the browser has cached does
not match the CSS the page expects.</li>
<li>Asset minification - Hugo can minimize CSS and JavaScript for you. This means browers have
to fetch less data.</li>
<li>Asset concatenation - Hugo can concatenate CSS and JavaScript. This allows you to serve
only one file per type, reducing the number of round trips a client has to make.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s also proper theming support, so you can easily clone a theme into the <code>themes/</code>
directory, or add it as a submodule like I do for my blog. But I don’t use it for the
website yet.</p>

<p>Oh, and Hugo automatically generates <code>sitemap.xml</code> files for your website, teaching
search engines which pages exist and when they have been modified.</p>

<p>I also like that it’s written in Go vs in Perl, but I think that’s just another <em>more modern</em>
type of thing. Gotta keep up with the world!</p>

<h2 id="basic-conversion">Basic conversion</h2>

<p>The first part to the conversion was to split the repository of the website: ikiwiki
puts templates into a <code>templates/</code> subdirectory of the repository and mixes all other
content. Hugo on the other hand splits things into <code>content/</code> (where pages go),
<code>layouts</code> (page templates), and <code>static/</code> (other files).</p>

<p>The second part was to inject the frontmatter into the markdown files. See, ikiwiki
uses shortcuts like this to set up the title, and gets its dates from git:</p>

<pre><code>[[!meta title="My page title"]]
</code></pre>

<p>on the other hand, Hugo uses frontmatter - some YAML at the beginning of the markdown,
and specifies the creation date in there:</p>

<pre><code>---
title: "My page title"
date: Thu, 18 Oct 2018 21:36:18 +0200
---
</code></pre>

<p>You can also have <code>lastmod</code> in there when modifying it, but I set <code>enableGitInfo = true</code>
in config.toml so Hugo picks up the mtime from the git repo.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://blog.jak-linux.org/post/ikiwiki-to-hugo.py">small script</a> to automatize those steps, but it was obviously
not perfect (also, it inserted lastmod, which it should not have).</p>

<p>One thing it took me some time to figure out was that <code>index.mdown</code> needs to become
<code>_index.md</code> in the <code>content/</code> directory of Hugo, otherwise no pages below it are
rendered - not entirely obvious.</p>

<h2 id="the-theme">The theme</h2>

<p>Converting the template was surprisingly easy, it was just a matter of replacing
<code>&lt;TMPL_VAR BASEURL&gt;</code> and friends with <code>{ .Site.BaseURL }</code> and friends - the names
are basically the same, just sometimes there’s <code>.Site</code> at the front of it.</p>

<p>Then I had to take care of the menu generation loop. I had my <code>bootmenu</code> plugin for ikiwiki which
allowed me to generate menus from the configuration file. The template for it looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TMPL_LOOP BOOTMENU&gt;
    &lt;TMPL_IF FIRSTNAV&gt;
        &lt;li &lt;TMPL_IF ACTIVE&gt;class="active"&lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;&gt;&lt;a href="&lt;TMPL_VAR URL&gt;"&gt;&lt;TMPL_VAR PAGE&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;
&lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I converted this to:</p>

<pre><code>{{ $currentPage := . }}
{{ range .Site.Menus.main }}
    &lt;li class="{{ if $currentPage.IsMenuCurrent "main" . }}active{{ end }}"&gt;
        &lt;a href="{{ .URL }}"&gt;
            {{ .Pre | safeHTML }}
            &lt;span&gt;{{ .Name }}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
        {{ .Post }}
    &lt;/li&gt;
{{ end }}
</code></pre>

<p>this allowed me to configure my menu in config.toml like this:</p>

<pre><code>[menu]

  [[menu.main]]
    name = "dh-autoreconf"
    url = "/projects/dh-autoreconf"
    weight = -110
</code></pre>

<p>I can also specify <code>pre</code> and <code>post</code> parts and a <code>right</code> menu, and I use <code>pre</code> and
<code>post</code> in the right menu to render a few icons before and after items, for example:</p>

<pre><code>  [[menu.right]]
    pre = "&lt;i class='fab fa-mastodon'&gt;&lt;/i&gt;"
    post = "&lt;i class='fas fa-external-link-alt'&gt;&lt;/i&gt;"
    url = "https://mastodon.social/@juliank"
    name = "Mastodon"
    weight = -70
</code></pre>

<p>Setting <code>class="active"</code> on the menu item does not seem to work yet, though; I think
I need to find out the right code for that…</p>

<h2 id="fixing-up-the-details">Fixing up the details</h2>

<p>Once I was done with that steps, the next stage was to convert ikiwiki <em>shortcodes</em>
to something hugo understands. This took 4 parts:</p>

<p>The first part was converting tables. In ikiwiki, tables look like this:</p>

<pre><code>[[!table format=dsv data="""
Status|License|Language|Reference
Active|GPL-3+|Java|[github](https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66)
"""]]
</code></pre>

<p>The generated HTML table had the <code>class="table"</code> set, which the bootstrap framework
needs to render a nice table. Converting that to a straightforward markdown hugo table
did not work: Hugo did not add the class, so I had to convert pages with tables in them
to the <code>mmark</code> variant of markdown, which allows classes to be set like this <code>{.table}</code>,
so the end result then looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>{.table}
Status|License|Language|Reference
------|-------|--------|---------
Active|GPL-3+|Java|[github](https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66)
</code></pre>

<p>I’ll be able to get rid of this in the future by using the bootstrap sources and
then having <code>table</code> inherit <code>.table</code> properties, but this requires saas or less, and
I only have the CSS at the moment, so using mmark was slightly easier.</p>

<p>The second part was converting ikiwiki links like <code>[[MyPage]]</code> and <code>[[my title|MyPage]]</code>
to Markdown links. This was quite easy, the first one became <code>[MyPage](MyPage)</code> and
the second one <code>[my title](my page)</code>.</p>

<p>The third part was converting custom shortcuts: I had <code>[[!lp &lt;number&gt;]]</code> to generate
a link <code>LP: #&lt;number&gt;</code> to the corresponding launchpad bug, and <code>[[!Closes &lt;number&gt;]]</code>
to generate <code>Closes: #&lt;number&gt;</code> links to the Debian bug tracker. I converted those
to normal markdown links, but I could have converted them to <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/">Hugo shortcodes</a>.
But meh.</p>

<p>The fourth part was about converting some directory indexes I had. For example,
<code>[[!map pages="projects/dir2ogg/0.12/* and ! projects/dir2ogg/0.12/*/*"]]</code> generated
a list of all files in <code>projects/dir2ogg/0.12</code>. There was a very useful shortcode
for that posted on the Hugo documentation, I used <a href="https://github.com/julian-klode/jak-linux.org/blob/f1d5e4d48046ff08d7612de5fa44e06b3c8c6be6/layouts/shortcodes/directoryindex.html">a variant of it</a> and then converted
pages like this to <code>{{&lt; directoryindex path="/static/projects/dir2ogg/0.12" pathURL="/projects/dir2ogg/0.12" &gt;}}</code>. As
a bonus, the new directory index also generates SHA256 hashes for all files!</p>

<h2 id="further-work">Further work</h2>

<p>The website is using an old version of bootstrap, and the theme is not split out yet. I’m
not sure if I want to keep a bootstrap theme for the website, seeing as the blog theme is
Bulma-based - it would be easier to have both use bulma.</p>

<p>I also might want to update both the website and the blog by pushing to GitHub and then
using CI to build and push it. That would allow me to write blog posts when I don’t have
my laptop with me. But I’m not sure, I might lose control if there’s a breach at travis.</p></description>

	<title>Kubuntu General News: Plasma 5.14.2 available in Cosmic backports PPA</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://kubuntu.org/?p=3962</guid>
	<link>https://kubuntu.org/news/plasma-5-14-2-available-in-cosmic-backports-ppa/</link>
	<description><p>After the 5.14.1 release of Plasma 5.14 was made available for Cosmic 18.10 via our backports PPA last week, we are pleased to say the the PPA has now been updated to the <a href="https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.14.2.php">2nd bugfix release 5.14.2</a>.</p>
<p>The full changelog for 5.14.2 can be <a href="https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.14.1-5.14.2-changelog.php">found here</a>.</p>
<p>Already released in the PPA is an update to the latest <a href="https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.51.0.php">KDE Frameworks 5.51</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To upgrade: </strong></p>
<p>Add the following repository to your software sources list:</p>
<p><strong><em>ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports</em></strong></p>
<p>or if it is already added, the updates should become available via your preferred update method.</p>
<p>The PPA can be added manually in the Konsole terminal with the command:</p>
<p><em>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports</em></p>
<p>and packages then updated with</p>
<p><em>sudo apt update</em><br />
<em>sudo apt full-upgrade</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>
<p><em>Please note that more bugfix releases are scheduled by KDE for Plasma 5.14, so while we feel these backports will be beneficial to enthusiastic adopters, users wanting to use a Plasma release with more stabilisation/bugfixes ‘baked in’ may find it advisable to stay with Plasma 5.13.5 as included in the original 18.10 Cosmic release. </em></p><em>
<p>Should any issues occur, please provide feedback on our mailing list [1], IRC [2], and/or file a bug against our PPA packages [3].</p>

	<title>Stephen Michael Kellat: Hard Question</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:skellat.freeshell.org,2018-10-23:/blog/hard-question.html</guid>
	<link>http://skellat.freeshell.org/blog/hard-question.html</link>
	<description><p>Well, there is big question I get asked frequently during the day that I have trouble answering.  You might be surprised at what it is.  Simply put: "How are you doing?"  </p>
<p>Things are <em>not</em> okay right now.  I try to put on a brave face at work and keep on slogging away.  We have a bit of "command uncertainty" in which the CEO and board of directors cannot come to a decision on how we're supposed to do things and the shareholders are electing people for seats on the board in two weeks.  Hopefully we do not get a repeat of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/americans-scream-helplessly-sky-donald-trump-election-anniversary-690889">citizens howling at the moon</a> shortly.  </p>
<p>Remember, I work for USA Inc. so to say.  </p>
<p>There has been an awesomely high level of stress at work.  A major chunk of September into October has been spent on trying to get that under control.  With greater responsibility in serving the public comes greater degrees of madness, it appears.  The citizenry certainly hasn't calmed down since last year's <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/americans-scream-helplessly-sky-donald-trump-election-anniversary-690889">howling at the moon</a> let alone the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brett_Kavanaugh&amp;oldid=865444995">Brett Kavanaugh affair</a>,  </p>
<p>I have at least opened an account on Liberapay since they're back up with two payment processors now.  When time permits I need to talk to some legal specialists at work to make sure I have my interpretations nailed down on income definitions and how to appropriately handle any income that would be derived from money sourced via Liberapay.  There are plenty of murky gray areas in tax law when it comes to things like Patreon and Liberapay in the United States where, unfortunately, I have seen equally persuasive yet completely contradictory outcomes happen.  If I take a leap of faith and seek pledges to go back to writing documentation as well as other works, I do want to keep a roof over my head if possible.  Until I get answers I am satisfied with, I won't directly link to my Liberapay profile but it is able to be found if you search for it.  </p>
<p>As we start to wind down 2018, I have some leaps of faith coming up it seems.  There aren't many safety nets under me.  Exciting adventures may lay ahead?</p></description>

	<title>Kees Cook: security things in Linux v4.19</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://outflux.net/blog/?p=1193</guid>
	<link>https://outflux.net/blog/archives/2018/10/22/security-things-in-linux-v4-19/</link>
	<description><p>Previously: <a href="http://outflux.net/blog/archives/2018/08/20/security-things-in-linux-v4-18/">v4.18</a>.</p>
<p>Linux kernel <a href="http://outflux.net/blog/archives/category/ubuntu/feed/">v4.19 was released today</a>. Here are some security-related things I found interesting:</p>
<p><strong>L1 Terminal Fault (L1TF)</strong></p>
<p>While it seems like ages ago, the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/958f338e96f874a0d29442396d6adf9c1e17aa2d">fixes for L1TF</a> actually landed at the start of the v4.19 merge window. As with the other speculation flaw fixes, lots of people were involved, and the scope was pretty wide: bare metal machines, virtualized machines, etc. LWN has a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/762570/">great write-up on the L1TF flaw</a> and the kernel’s <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/l1tf.html">documentation on L1TF defenses</a> is equally detailed. I like how clean the solution is for bare-metal machines: when a page table entry should be marked invalid, instead of only changing the “Present” flag, it also inverts the address portion so even a speculative lookup ignoring the “Present” flag will land in an unmapped area.</p>
<p><strong>protected regular and fifo files</strong></p>
<p>Salvatore Mesoraca implemented an <code>O_CREAT</code> restriction in <code>/tmp</code> directories for <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/30aba6656f61ed44cba445a3c0d38b296fa9e8f5">FIFOs and regular files</a>. This is similar to the existing <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/800179c9b8a1e796e441674776d11cd4c05d61d7">symlink restrictions</a>, which take effect in sticky world-writable directories (e.g. <code>/tmp</code>) when the opening user does not match the owner of the existing file (or directory). When a program opens a FIFO or regular file with <code>O_CREAT</code> and this kind of user mismatch, it is treated like it was also opened with <code>O_EXCL</code>: it gets rejected because there is already a file there, and the kernel wants to protect the program from writing possibly sensitive contents to a file owned by a different user. This has become a more common attack vector now that symlink and hardlink races have been eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>syscall register clearing, arm64</strong></p>
<p>One of the ways attackers can influence potential speculative execution flaws in the kernel is to leak information into the kernel via “unused” register contents. Most syscalls take only a few arguments, so all the other <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscall.2.html#NOTES">calling-convention-defined registers</a> can be cleared instead of just left with whatever contents they had in userspace. As it turns out, clearing registers is very fast. Similar to what was done on <a href="http://outflux.net/blog/archives/2018/06/14/security-things-in-linux-v4-17/">x86</a>, Mark Rutland implemented a full <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/4378a7d4be30ec6994702b19936f7d1465193541">register-clearing syscall wrapper on arm64</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Variable Length Array removals, part 3</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://outflux.net/blog/archives/2018/06/14/security-things-in-linux-v4-17/">part 1</a> and <a href="http://outflux.net/blog/archives/2018/08/20/security-things-in-linux-v4-18/">part 2</a>, VLAs continue to be removed from the kernel. While <code>CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK</code> and <code>CONFIG_VMAP_STACK</code> cover most issues with stack exhaustion attacks, not all architectures have those features, so getting rid of VLAs makes sure we keep a few classes of flaws out of all kernel architectures and configurations. It’s been a long road, and it’s shaping up to be a 4-part saga with the remaining VLA removals landing in the next kernel. For v4.19, several folks continued to help <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?h=v4.19&amp;qt=grep&amp;q=VLA+usage">grind away at the problem</a>: Arnd Bergmann, Kyle Spiers, Laura Abbott, Martin Schwidefsky, Salvatore Mesoraca, and myself.</p>
<p><strong>shift overflow helper</strong><br />
Jason Gunthorpe noticed that while the kernel <a href="http://outflux.net/blog/archives/2018/08/20/security-things-in-linux-v4-18/">recently gained add/sub/mul/div helpers to check for arithmetic overflow</a>, we didn’t have anything for shift-left. He added <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/0c66847793d1982d1083dc6f7adad60fa265ce9c">check_shl_overflow()</a> to round out the toolbox and Leon Romanovsky immediately put it to use to <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/0dfe452241f4904de497aef01ad2f609ccb9be90">solve an overflow in RDMA</a>.</p>
<p><i>Edit: I forgot to mention this next feature when I first posted:</i></p>
<p><strong>trusted architecture-supported RNG initialization</strong></p>
<p>The Random Number Generator in the kernel seeds its pools from many entropy sources, including any architecture-specific sources (e.g. x86’s <code>RDRAND</code>). Due to many people not wanting to trust the architecture-specific source due to the inability to audit its operation, entropy from those sources was not credited to RNG initialization, which wants to gather “enough” entropy before claiming to be initialized. However, because some systems don’t generate enough entropy at boot time, it was taking a while to gather enough system entropy (e.g. from interrupts) before the RNG became usable, which might block userspace from starting (e.g. <code>systemd</code> wants to get early entropy). To help these cases, Ted T’so introduced a <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/39a8883a2b989d1d21bd8dd99f5557f0c5e89694">toggle to trust the architecture-specific entropy completely</a> (i.e. RNG is considered fully initialized as soon as it gets the architecture-specific entropy). To use this, the kernel can be built with <code>CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_CPU=y</code> (or booted with “<code>random.trust_cpu=on</code>“).</p>
<p>That’s it for now; thanks for reading. The merge window is open for v4.20! Wish us luck. :)</p>

	<title>Benjamin Mako Hill: Why organizational culture matters for online groups</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/?p=3078</guid>
	<link>https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/why-organizational-culture-matters-for-online-groups</link>
	<description><p>Leaders and scholars of online communities tend of think of community growth as the aggregate effect of inexperienced individuals arriving one-by-one. However, there is <a href="https://chenhaot.com/pubs/community_genealogy/community-genealogy.pdf">increasing evidence</a> that growth in many online communities today involves newcomers arriving in groups with previous experience together in other communities. This difference has deep implications for how we think about the process of integrating newcomers. Instead of focusing only on individual socialization into the group culture, we must also understand how to manage <em>mergers</em> of existing groups with distinct cultures. Unfortunately, online community mergers have, to our knowledge, never been studied systematically.</p>
<p>To better understand mergers, my student <a href="https://ckiene.org/">Charlie Kiene</a> spent six months in 2017 conducting ethnographic participant observation in two <em>World of Warcraf</em>t raid guilds planning and undergoing mergers. The results—visible in the attendance plot below—shows that the top merger led to a thriving and sustainable community while the bottom merger led to failure and the eventual dissolution of the group. <strong>Why did one merger succeed while the other failed? What can managers of other communities learn from these examples? </strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://mako.cc/academic/kiene_shaw_hill-managing_organizational_culture-PREPRINT.pdf">a new paper</a> that will be published in the <em>Proceedings of of the ACM Conference on Computer-supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (</em><a href="https://cscw.acm.org/2018/"><em>CSCW</em></a><em>)</em> and that Charlie will present in New Jersey next month, I teamed up with Charlie and Aaron Shaw try to answer these questions.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_666" style="width: 800px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-666 size-full" height="582" src="https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/guild_merger_graph.png" width="800" />Raid team attendance before and after merging. Guilds were given pseudonyms to protect the identity of the research subjects.</figure>
<p>In our research setting, <em>World of Warcraft</em> (WoW), players form organized groups called “guilds” to take on the game’s toughest bosses in virtual dungeons that are called “raids.” Raids can be extremely challenging, and they require a large number of players to be successful. Below is a video demonstrating the kind of communication and coordination needed to be successful as a raid team in WoW.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because participation in a raid guild requires time, discipline, and emotional investment, raid guilds are constantly losing members and recruiting new ones to resupply their ranks. One common strategy for doing so is arranging formal <a href="https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/search?q=guild+merge&amp;forum=">mergers</a>. Our study involved following two such groups as they completed mergers. To collect data for our study, Charlie joined both groups, attended and recorded all activities, took copious field notes, and spent hours interviewing leaders.</p>
<p>Although our team did not anticipate the divergent outcomes shown in the figure above when we began, we analyzed our data with an eye toward identifying themes that might point to reasons for the success of one merger and the failure of the other. The answers that emerged from our analysis suggest that the key differences that led one merger to be successful and the other to fail revolved around differences in the ways that the two mergers managed <em>organizational culture</em>. This basic insight is supported by a body of research about organizational culture in firms but seem to have not made it onto the radar of most members or scholars of online communities. My coauthors and I think more attention to the role that organizational culture plays in online communities is essential.</p>
<p>We found evidence of cultural incompatibility in both mergers and it seems likely that some degree of cultural clashes is inevitable in any merger. The most important result of our analysis are three observations we drew about specific things that the successful merger did to effectively manage organizational culture. Drawn from our analysis, these themes point to concrete things that other communities facing mergers—either formal or informal—can do.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_665" style="width: 600px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-665 size-full" height="374" src="https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/guild_merger_recruitment.png" width="600" />A recent, random example of a guild merger recruitment post found on the WoW forums.</figure>
<p>First, when planning mergers, groups can <strong>strategically select other groups with similar organizational culture</strong>. The successful merger in our study involved a carefully planned process of advertising for a potential merger on forums, testing out group compatibility by participating in “trial” raid activities with potential guilds, and selecting the guild that most closely matched their own group’s culture. In our settings, this process helped prevent conflict from emerging and ensured that there was enough common ground to resolve it when it did.</p>
<p>Second,<strong> leaders can plan intentional opportunities to socialize members of the merged or acquired group</strong>. The leaders of the successful merger held community-wide social events in the game to help new members learn their community’s norms. They spelled out these norms in a visible list of rules. They even included the new members in both the brainstorming and voting process of changing the guild’s name to reflect that they were a single, new, cohesive unit. The leaders of the failed merger lacked any explicitly stated community rules, and opportunities for socializing the members of the new group were virtually absent. Newcomers from the merged group would only learn community norms when they broke one of the unstated social codes.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_664" style="width: 800px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-664 size-full" height="450" src="https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/guild_merger_hall_of_fame.png" width="800" />The guild leaders in the successful merger documented every successful high end raid boss achievement in a community-wide “Hall of Fame” journal. A screenshot is taken with every guild member who contributed to the achievement and uploaded to a “Hall of Fame” page.</figure>
<p>Third and finally, our study suggested that <strong>social activities can be used to cultivate solidarity</strong> between the two merged groups, leading to increased retention of new members. We found that the successful guild merger organized an additional night of activity that was socially-oriented. In doing so, they provided a setting where solidarity between new and existing members can cultivate and motivate their members to stick around and keep playing with each other—even when it gets frustrating.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that by preparing in advance, ensuring some degree of cultural compatibility, and providing opportunities to socialize newcomers and cultivate solidarity, the potential for conflict resulting from mergers can be mitigated. While mergers between firms often occur to make more money or consolidate resources, the experience of the failed merger in our study shows that mergers between online communities put their entire communities at stake. We hope our work can be used by leaders in online communities to successfully manage potential conflict resulting from merging or acquiring members of other groups in a wide range of settings.</p>

	<title>Ubuntu MATE: Ubuntu MATE 18.10 Final Release</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/ubuntu-mate-cosmic-final-release/</guid>
	<link>https://ubuntu-mate.org/blog/ubuntu-mate-cosmic-final-release/</link>
	<description><div><p><strong>Ubuntu MATE 18.10 is a modest, yet strategic, upgrade over our 18.04
release. If you want bug fixes and improved hardware support then 18.10 is for
you. For those who prefer staying on the LTS then everything in this 18.10
release is also important for the upcoming 18.04.2 release. Oh yeah, we've
also made a <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/gpd-pocket/">bespoke Ubuntu MATE 18.10 image for the GPD Pocket and GPD Pocket
2</a>. Read on to learn more...</strong></p>
<div align="center">

  <b>Superposition on the Intel Core i7-8809G Radeon RX Vega M powered Hades Canyon NUC</b>
</div>

<h3>What changed since the Ubuntu MATE 18.04 final release?</h3>
<p>Curiously, the work during this Ubuntu MATE 18.10 release has really been
focused on what will become Ubuntu MATE 18.04.2. Let me explain.</p>
<h4>MATE Desktop</h4>
<p>The upstream MATE Desktop team have been working on many bug fixes for <strong>MATE
Desktop 1.20.3</strong>, that has resulted in a lot of maintenance updates in the
upstream releases of MATE Desktop. The Debian packaging team for MATE Desktop,
of which I am member, has been updating all the MATE packages to track these
upstream bug fixes and new releases. Just about all MATE Desktop packages and
associated components, such as AppMenu and MATE Dock Applet have been updated.
Now that all these fixes exist in the 18.10 release, we will start the process
of SRU'ing (backporting) them to 18.04 so that they will feature in the Ubuntu
MATE 18.04.2 release due in February 2019. The fixes should start landing in
Ubuntu MATE 18.04 very soon, well before the February deadline.</p>
<h4>Hardware Enablement</h4>
<p>Ubuntu MATE 18.04.2 will include a hardware enablement stack (HWE) based on
what is shipped in Ubuntu 18.10. Ubuntu users are increasingly adopting the
current generation of AMD RX Vega GPUs, both discrete and integrated solutions
such as the Intel Core i7-8809G Radeon RX Vega M found in the Hades Canyon NUC
and some laptops. I have been lobbying people within the Ubuntu project to
upgrade to newer versions of the Linux kernel, firmware, Mesa and Vulkan that
offer the best possible "out of box" support for AMD GPUs. Consequently,
Ubuntu 18.10 (of any flavour) is great for owners of AMD graphics solutions
and these improvements will soon be available in Ubuntu 18.04.2 too.</p>
<h4>GPD Pocket</h4>
<p>Alongside the generic image for 64-bit Intel PCs we're also releasing a
bespoke image for the <a href="https://gpd.hk/gpdpocket">GPD Pocket</a> and
<a href="https://gpd.hk/gpdpocket2">GPD Pocket 2</a> that includes the hardware
specific tweaks to get these devices working <em>"out of the box"</em>
without any faffing about. <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/gpd-pocket/">See our GPD Pocket page for more details</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><br /></p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi images</h3>
<p>We're planning on releasing <strong>Ubuntu MATE images for the Raspberry Pi after
that 18.10 release is out, in October 2018</strong>. It takes usually takes about a
month to get the Raspberry Pi images built and tested, but we've encountered
some challenges with the 18.04 based images which has delayed their release.
Hopefully we'll have something in time for Christmas 2018 <code>:-)</code></p>
<h3>Major Applications</h3>
<p>Accompanying <strong>MATE Desktop 1.20.3</strong> and <strong>Linux 4.18</strong> are <strong>Firefox
59.0.2</strong>, <strong>VLC 3.0.4</strong>, <strong>LibreOffice 6.1.2.1</strong> and <strong>Thunderbird 60.2.1</strong>.</p>

	<title>Stuart Langridge: Print to Google Drive in a non-Gnome desktop</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.kryogenix.org,2018-10-15:/days/2018/10/15/print-to-google-drive-in-a-non-gnome-desktop/</guid>
	<link>http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2018/10/15/print-to-google-drive-in-a-non-gnome-desktop/</link>
	<description><p>Jeremy Bicha wrote up an unknown Ubuntu feature: <a href="https://jeremy.bicha.net/2018/10/14/google-cloud-print-in-ubuntu/">“printing” direct to a Google Drive <span class="caps">PDF</span></a>. I rather wanted this, but I don’t run the Gnome desktop, so I thought I might be out of luck. But no! It works fine on my Ubuntu <span class="caps">MATE</span> desktop too. A couple of extra tweaks are required, though. This is unfortunately a bit technical, but it should only need setting up once.</p>
<p>You need the Gnome Control Centre and Gnome Online Accounts installed, if you don’t have them already, as well as the Google Cloud Print extension that Jeremy mentions. From a terminal, run <code>sudo apt install gnome-control-center gnome-online-accounts cpdb-backend-gcp</code>.</p>
<p>Next, you need to launch the Control Centre, but it doesn’t like you if you’re not running the Gnome desktop. So, we lie to it. In that terminal, run <code>XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME gnome-control-center online-accounts</code>. This should correctly start the Control Centre, showing the online accounts. Sign in to your Google account using that window. (I only have Files and Printers selected; you don’t need Mail and Calendars and so on to get this printing working.) </p>
<p>Then… it all works. From now on, when you go to print something, the print dialogue will, after a couple of seconds, show a new entry: “Save to Google Drive”. Choose that, and your document will “print” to a <span class="caps">PDF</span> stored in Google Drive. Easy peasy. Nice one Jeremy for the write-up. It’d be neat if Ubuntu <span class="caps">MATE</span> could integrate this a little more tightly.</p></description>

	<title>Michael Zanetti: nymea</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://notyetthere.org/?p=508</guid>
	<link>http://notyetthere.org/nymea/</link>
	<description><p>It’s been quite a while since I had written a post now. Lots of things have changed around here but even though I am not actively developing for Ubuntu itself any more it doesn’t mean that I’ve left the Ubuntu and FOSS world in general. In fact, I’ve been pretty busy hacking on some more free software goodness. Some few have sure heard about it, but for the biggest part, allow me to introduce you to nymea.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-medium" height="150" src="https://nymea.io/app/default/assets/addons/default/guh/default-theme/resources/img/nymea-logo.svg?v=1539086743" width="292" /><br />
nymea is an IoT platform mainly based on Ubuntu. Well, that’s where we develop on, we provide packages for debian and snaps for all the platforms supporting snaps too.</p>
<p>It consists of 3 parts: nymea:core, nymea:app and nymea:cloud.<br />
The purpose of this project is to enable easy integration of various things with each other. Being plugin-based, it allows to make all sorts of things (devices, online services…) work together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large" src="https://nymea.io/app/default/assets/addons/default/guh/default-theme/resources/img/services/services-desktop-2.svg?v=1539088904" width="500" /></p>
<p>Practically speaking this means two things:</p>
<p>– It will allow users to have a completely open source smart home setup which does everything offline. Everything is processed offline, including the smartness. Turning your living room lights on when it gets dark? nymea will do it, and it’ll do it even without your internet connection. It comes with nymea:core to be installed on a gateway device in your home (a Raspberry Pi, or any other device that can run Ubuntu/Debian or snapd) and nymea:app, available in app stores and also as a desktop app in the snap store.</p>
<p>– It delivers a developer platform for device makers. Looking for a solution that easily allows you to make your device smart? Ubuntu:core + nymea:core together will get you sorted in no time to have an app for your “thing” and allow it to react on just about any input it gets.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guh/nymea-wiki/master/docs/en/images/android-app-5.png" width="200" /><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guh/nymea-wiki/master/docs/en/images/android-app-4.png" width="200" /><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guh/nymea-wiki/master/docs/en/images/android-app-2.png" width="200" /></p>
<p>nymea:cloud is an optional feature to nymea:core and nymea:app and allows to extend the nymea system with features like remote connection, push notifications or Alexa integration (not released yet).</p>
<p>So if that got you curious, check out <a href="https://wiki.nymea.io">https://wiki.nymea.io</a> (and perhaps <a href="http://notyetthere.org/category/ubuntu/feed/nymea.io">https://nymea.io</a> in general) or simply install nymea and nymea-app and get going (on snap systems you need to connect some plugs and iterfaces for all the bits and pieces to work, alternatively we have a ppa ready for use too).</p></description>

	<title>Jeremy Bicha: Google Cloud Print in Ubuntu</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://jeremy.bicha.net/?p=431</guid>
	<link>https://jeremy.bicha.net/2018/10/14/google-cloud-print-in-ubuntu/</link>
	<description><p>There is an interesting hidden feature available in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and newer. To enable this feature, first install <em>cpdb-backend-gcp.</em></p>

<p></p><pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">sudo apt install cpdb-backend-gcp</pre><p></p>

<p>Make sure you are signed in to Google with GNOME Online Accounts. Open the Settings app<span class="inline-footnote" title="gnome-control-center">1<span class="footnoteContent" style="display: none;">gnome-control-center</span></span> to the Online Accounts page. If your Google account is near the top above the <em>Add an account</em> section, then you’re all set.</p>

<p>Currently, only LibreOffice is supported. Hopefully, for 19.04, other GTK+ apps will be able to use the feature.</p>

<p>This feature was developed by <a href="https://nilanjanalodh.github.io/common-print-dialog-gsoc17/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Nilanjana Lodh</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/dracarys09/gcp-backend/wiki/1.-Google-Summer-of-Code-2017-%7C-Common-Printing-Dialog" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Abhijeet Dubey</strong></a> when they were Google Summer of Code 2017 participants. Their mentors were Till Kamppeter, Aveek Basu, and Felipe Borges.</p>

<p>Till has been <a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/1747762" target="_blank">trying</a> to get this feature installed by default in Ubuntu since 18.04 LTS, but it looks like it won’t make it in until 19.04.</p>

<p>I haven’t seen this feature packaged in any other Linux distros yet. That might be because people don’t know about this feature so that’s why I’m posting about it today! If you are a distro packager, the 3 packages you need are <a href="https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-libs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cpdb-libs</a> , <a href="https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-backend-gcp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cpdb-backend-gcp</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cpdb-backend-cups" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cpdb-backend-cups</a>. The final package enables easy printing to any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><abbr title="Internet Printing Protocol">IPP</abbr> printer</a>. (I didn’t mention it earlier because I believe Ubuntu 18.04 LTS already supports that feature through a different package.)</p>

<h2>Save to Google Drive<br /></h2>

<p>In my original blog post, I confused the <em>cpdb</em> feature with a feature that already exists in GTK3 built with GNOME Online Accounts support. This should already work on most distros.</p>

<p>When you print a document, there will be an extra <em>Save to Google Drive</em> option. Saving to Google Drive saves a PDF of your document to your <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> account.<br /></p>

<p></p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img alt="" class="wp-image-432" src="https://jeremy.bicha.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ubuntu-save-to-google-drive.png" /></figure></div>

<p><em>This post was edited on October 16 to mention that </em>cpdb<em> only supports LibreOffice now and that </em>Save to Google Drive<em> is a GTK3 feature instead.</em></p>

<p><em>October 17: Please see Felipe’s comments. It turns out that even Google Cloud Print works fine in distros with recent GTK3. The point of the </em>cpdb<em> feature is to make this work in apps that </em>don’t<em> use GTK3. So I guess the big benefit now is that you can use Google Cloud Print or Save to Google Drive from LibreOffice.</em><br /></p>

	<title>Julian Andres Klode: The demise of G+ and return to blogging (w/ mastodon integration)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.jak-linux.org/2018/10/13/new-blog/</guid>
	<link>https://blog.jak-linux.org/2018/10/13/new-blog/</link>
	<description><p>I’m back to blogging, after shutting down my wordpress.com hosted
blog in spring. This time, fully privacy aware, self hosted, and
integrated with mastodon.</p>

<p>Let’s talk details: In spring, I shutdown my wordpress.com hosted
blog, due to concerns about GDPR implications with comment hosting
and ads and stuff. I’d like to apologize for using that, back when I
did this (in <a href="https://blog.jak-linux.org/2007/12/20/hello-world/">2007</a>), it was the easiest way
to get into blogging. Please forgive me for subjecting you to that!</p>

<p>Recently, Google announced the end of Google+. As some of you might
know, I posted a lot of medium-long posts there, rather than doing
blog posts; especially after I disabled the wordpress site.</p>

<p>With the end of Google+, I want to try something new: I’ll host longer
pieces on this blog, and post shorter messages on
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@juliank">@juliank@mastodon.social</a>. If you
follow the Mastodon account, you will see toots for each new blog post
as well, linking to the blog post.</p>

<h2 id="mastodon-integration-and-privacy">Mastodon integration and privacy</h2>

<p>Now comes the interesting part: If you reply to the toot, your reply
will be shown on the blog itself. This works with a tiny bit of JavaScript
that talks to a simple server-side script that finds toots from me
mentioning the blog post, and then replies to that.</p>

<p>This protects your privacy, because mastodon.social does not see which
blog post you are looking at, because it is contacted by the server, not
by you. Rendering avatars requires loading images from mastodon.social’s
file server, however - to improve your privacy, all avatars are loaded
with <code>referrerpolicy='no-referrer'</code>, so assuming your browser is half-way
sane, it should not be telling mastodon.social which post you visited
either. In fact, the entire domain also sets <code>Referrer-Policy: no-referrer</code>
as an http header, so any link you follow will not have a referrer set.</p>

<p>The integration was originally written by <a href="https://mastodon.social/@bjoern">@bjoern@mastodon.social</a>
– I have done some moderate improvements to adapt it to my theme,
make it more reusable, and replace and extend the caching done in
a JSON file with a Redis database.</p>

<h2 id="source-code">Source code</h2>

<p>This blog is free software; generated by the <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> snap. All
source code for it is available:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The blog posts are provided at <a href="https://github.com/julian-klode/blog.jak-linux.org">github.com/julian-klode/blog.jak-linux.org</a>.
under the terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> license.</p></li>

<li><p>The theme is called Ernest, and is a fork of the Hemingway theme. You
can find it at <a href="https://github.com/julian-klode/ernest">github.com/julian-klode/ernest</a>. It
is licensed under the MIT license, with server-side scripts under the AGPL,
and some vendorized parts under different licenses.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(Yes I am aware that hosting the repositories on GitHub is a bit ironic
given the whole focus on privacy and self-hosting).</p>

<p>The theme makes use of Hugo pipes to minify and fingerprint JavaScript,
and vendorizes all dependencies instead of embedding CDN links, to, again,
protect your privacy.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>

<p>I think I want to make the theme dark, to be more friendly to the
eyes. I also might want to make the mastodon integration a bit more
friendly to use. And I want to get rid of jQuery, it’s only used for
a handful of calls in the Mastodon integration JavaScript.</p>

<p>If you have any other idea for improvements, feel free to join the conversation in the
mastodon toot, send me an email, or open an issue at the github projects.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>I think the end of Google+ will be an interesting time, requring a lot
of people in the open source world to replace one of their main
communication channels with a different approach.</p>

<p>Mastodon and Diaspora are both in the race, and I fear the community
will split or everyone will have two accounts in the end. I personally
think that Mastodon + syndicated blogs provide a good balance: You can
quickly write short posts (up to 500 characters), and you can host long
articles on your own and link to them.</p>

<p>I hope that one day diaspora* and mastodon federate together. If we
end up with one federated network that would be the best outcome.</p></description>

	<title>Jeremy Bicha: Shutter removed from Debian & Ubuntu</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://jeremy.bicha.net/?p=425</guid>

	<description><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://jeremy.bicha.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shutter.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-426" src="https://jeremy.bicha.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/shutter.png" /></a></figure></div>

<p>This week, the popular screenshot app Shutter was removed from Debian Unstable &amp; Ubuntu 18.10. (It had already been removed from Debian “Buster” 6 months ago and some of its “optional” dependencies had already been <a href="https://launchpad.net/bugs/1765726" target="_blank">removed</a> from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS).</p>

<p>Shutter will need to be ported to gtk3 before it can return to Debian. (Ideally, it would support Wayland desktops too but that’s not a blocker for inclusion in Debian.)</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/870418" target="_blank">Debian bug</a> for more discussion.</p>

<p>I am told that <a href="https://github.com/lupoDharkael/flameshot" target="_blank">flameshot</a> is a nice well-maintained screenshot app.</p>

<p>I believe <a href="https://snapcraft.io/" target="_blank">Snap</a> or <a href="https://flatpak.org/" target="_blank">Flatpak</a> are great ways to make apps that use obsolete libraries available on modern distros that can no longer keep those libraries around. There isn’t a Snap or Flatpak version of Shutter yet, so hopefully someone interested in that will help create one.</p></description>
